# About locales

Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

Did you come here to change something?  
`de-DE.json` and `fr-FR.json` are auto-generated, a pull request with them 
won't be accepted because your changes would be overwritten on import.

You can edit all the translations here:

Thank you for your interest in translating KeeWeb!
